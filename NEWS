      Barker).
    * Add 'Close Other Documents' File menu command (#1976724).

      ~/.geany/templates/files directory, shown underneath filetype templates
      in the New with Template menu.
    * Make socket open command support filename:line:column syntax.
    * Add filetypes.* [build_settings] key 'error_regex' to support custom
      error message parsing using a GNU-style extended regular expression.

    * Add alternative build system: Waf.
    * Add Tools menu item to reload configuration data without a restart.

      (#1930435).
    * Add files pref 'Open new documents from the command-line'.

      column' editor pref (for now only works when typing characters past
      the line breaking column number).
    * Don't colourise any documents until they need to be drawn (this
      should make opening a session faster for filetypes that support typename
      highlighting).
    * Make Ctrl-click on a word perform Go to Tag Definition.
    * Add 'Max. symbol name suggestions' autocompletion pref.
    * Show ellipsis (...) item when there are too many symbol names for

      Type.

      Oster; #2129157).
    * Add "Replace spaces by tabs".
