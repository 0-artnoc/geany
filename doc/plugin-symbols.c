 * and must be defined. Some symbols should only be declared using specific macros in
 * @link plugindata.h @endlink.

 * - The @c name field must not be empty or match Geany's default group name.
 * - The @c label field is set by Geany after init() is called to the name of the
 * plugin.
 * @note This is a single element array for implementation reasons,
