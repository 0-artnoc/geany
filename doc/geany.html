<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" id="about-geany" name="about-geany">About Geany</a></h2>
<p>Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment. It
was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few
dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent
as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME,
so Geany only requires the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you only need
the GTK2 runtime libraries installed to run it.</p>
<p>Some basic features of Geany are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Auto completion of often-used constructs like &quot;if&quot;, &quot;for&quot; and &quot;while&quot;</li>
<li>Auto completion of XML and HTML tags</li>
<li>Call tips</li>
<li>Many supported filetypes including C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl,
Pascal, and others</li>
<li>Tag/Symbol lists</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" id="where-to-get-it" name="where-to-get-it">Where to get it</a></h2>
<p>You can obtain Geany from <a class="reference" href="http://geany.uvena.de">http://geany.uvena.de</a> or perhaps also from
your distributor.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="requirements" name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>For compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK (&gt;= 2.6.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need the Pango, Glib and
ATK libraries and header files. All these files are available at
<a class="reference" href="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; a
C++ compiler is also required for the included Scintilla library. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="source-compilation" name="source-compilation">Source compilation</a></h2>
<p>Compiling Geany is quite easy. The following should do it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</pre>
<p>The configure script supports several common options, for a detailed
list, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% ./configure --help
</pre>
<p>There also some compile time options which can be found in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/geany.h</span></tt>. Please see <a class="reference" href="#compile-time-options">Compile-time options</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>In the case that your system lacks dynamic linking loader support, you
probably want to pass the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--disable-vte</span></tt> to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">configure</span></tt>
script. This prevents compiling Geany with dynamic linking loader
support to automatically load <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvte.so.4</span></tt> if available.</p>
<p>Geany has been successfully compiled and tested under Debian 3.1
Sarge, Debian 4.0 Etch, Fedora Core 3/4/5, LinuxFromScratch and
FreeBSD 6.0. It also compiles under Microsoft Windows™.</p>
<p>If there are any errors during compilation, check your build
environment and try to find the error, otherwise contact the author
at &lt;enrico(dot)troeger(at)uvena(dot)de&gt;.</p>

<p>At startup, Geany loads all files from the last time Geany was
launched. You can disable this feature in the preferences dialog
(see <a class="reference" href="#general-tab-in-preferences-dialog">General tab in preferences dialog</a>). If you specify some
files on the command line, only these files will be opened, but you
can find the files from the last session in the file menu under the
&quot;Recent files&quot; item. By default this contains the last 10 recently
opened files. You can change the amount of recently opened files in
the preferences dialog.</p>
<p>You can start several instances of Geany, but only the first will
load files from the last session. To run a second instance of Geany,
do not specify any filenames on the command-line, or disable opening
files in a running instance using the appropriate command line option.</p>

<p>Geany detects an already running instance of itself and opens files
from the command-line in the already running instance. So, Geany can
be used to view and edit files by opening them from other programs
such as a file manager. If you do not like this for some reason, you

<p>If you have installed <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvte.so</span></tt> in your system, it is loaded
automatically by Geany, and you will have a terminal widget in the
notebook at the bottom.</p>
<p>If Geany cannot find any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvte.so</span></tt> at startup, the terminal widget
will not be loaded. So there is no need to install the package containing
this file in order to run Geany. Additionally, you can disable the use
of the terminal widget by command line option, for more information
see the section called <a class="reference" href="#command-line-options">Command line options</a>.</p>
<p>You can use this terminal (from now on called VTE) nearly as an usual
terminal program like xterm. There is basic clipboard support. You
can paste the contents of the clipboard by pressing the right mouse
button to open the popup menu and choosing Paste. To copy text from
the VTE, just select the desired text and then press the right mouse
button and choose Copy from the popup menu. On systems running the
X Window System you can paste the last selected text by pressing the
middle mouse button in the VTE (on 2-button mice, the middle button
can often be simulated by pressing both mouse buttons together).</p>
<p>In the preferences dialog you can specify a shell which should be
started in the VTE. To make the specified shell a login shell just
use the appropriate command line options for the shell. These options
should be found in the manual page of the shell. For zsh and bash
you can use the argument <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--login</span></tt>.</p>

Geany installation on Windows).</p>
<p>To get a defined style get noticed by Geany you must it assign to
one of Geany's widgets. To do so, use the following line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
widget &quot;Geany*&quot; style &quot;geany_style&quot;
</pre>
<p>This would assign your already defined style &quot;geany_style&quot; to all Geany

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19" id="character-sets-and-unicode-byte-order-mark-bom" name="character-sets-and-unicode-byte-order-mark-bom">Character sets and Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM)</a></h2>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" id="using-character-sets" name="using-character-sets">Using character sets</a></h3>
<p>Geany provides support for detecting and converting character sets. So
you can open and save files in different character sets and even
can convert a file from a character set to another one. To do this,
Geany uses the character conversion capabilities of the GLib.</p>
<p>Only text files are supported, i.e. opening files which contain
NUL-bytes may fail. Geany will try to open the file anyway but it is
likely that the file will be truncated because it can only opened up
to the first occurrence of the first NUL-byte. All characters after
this position are lost and are not written when you save the file.</p>
<p>Geany tries to detect the encoding of a file while opening it. It
might be that the encoding of a file cannot be detected correctly so
you have to set manually the encoding of the file in order to display
it correctly. You can this in the file open dialog by selecting
an encoding in the drop down box or by reloading the file with the
file menu item &quot;Reload as&quot;. The auto detection works well for most
encodings but there are also some encodings known where auto detection
has its problems. Auto detecting the encoding of a file is not easy
and sometimes an encoding might be detected not correctly.</p>
<p>There are different ways to use different encodings in Geany:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Using the file open dialog</p>
<p>This opens the file with the encoding specified in the encoding drop
down box. If the encoding is set to &quot;Detect from file&quot; auto detection
will be used. If the encoding is set to &quot;Without encoding (None)&quot; the
file will be opened without any character conversion and Geany will
not try to auto detect the encoding(see below for more information).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using the &quot;Reload as&quot; menu item</p>
<p>This item reloads the current file with the specified encoding. It can
help if you opened a file and found out that a wrong encoding was used.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using the &quot;Set encoding&quot; menu item</p>
<p>In contrary to the above two options, this will not change or reload
the current file unless you save it. It is useful when you want to
change the encoding of the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21" id="special-encoding-none" name="special-encoding-none">Special encoding &quot;None&quot;</a></h3>
<p>There is a special encoding &quot;None&quot; which is actually no real
encoding. It is useful when you know that Geany cannot auto detect
the encoding of a file and it is not displayed correctly. Especially
when the file contains NUL-bytes this can be useful to skip auto
detection and open the file properly at least until the occurrence
of the first NUL-byte. Using this encoding opens the file as it is
without any character conversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22" id="unicode-byte-order-mark-bom" name="unicode-byte-order-mark-bom">Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM)</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Geany detects an Unicode Byte Order Mark (see
<a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark</a> for details). Of course,
this feature is only available if the opened file is in an unicode
encoding. The Byte Order Mark helps to detect the encoding of a file,
e.g. whether it is UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE and so on. On Unix-like systems
using a Byte Order Mark could cause some problems, e.g. the gcc stops
with stray errors, PHP does not parse a script containing a BOM and
script files starting with a she-bang maybe cannot be started. In the
status bar you can easily see whether the file starts with a BOM or
not. If you want to set a BOM for a file or if you want to remove it
from a file, just use the document menu and toggle the checkbox.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are unsure what a BOM is or if you do not understand where
to use it, then it is not important for you and you can safely

a new line will be indented after typing ':' at the end of a line.</dd>

<dd>Similar to <em>Current chars</em> but the closing brace will be aligned to
match the indentation of the line with the opening brace.</dd>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26" id="bookmarks" name="bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></h3>
<p>Geany provides a handy bookmarking feature that lets you mark one
or more lines in a document, and return the cursor to them using a
key combination.</p>
<p>To place a mark on a line, either left-mouse-click in the left margin
of the editor window, or else use Ctrl-m. Either way, this will
produce a small green plus symbol in the margin. You can have as many
marks in a document as you like. Click again (or use Ctrl-m again)
to remove the bookmark. To remove all the marks in a given document,
use &quot;Remove Markers&quot; in the Document menu.</p>
<p>To navigate down your document, jumping from one mark to the next,
use Ctrl-. (control period). To go in the opposite direction on
the page, use Ctrl-, (control comma). Using the bookmarking feature
together with the commands to switch from one editor tab to another
(Ctrl-PgUp/PgDn and Ctrl-Tab) provides a particularly fast way to
navigate around multiple files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27" id="code-navigation-history" name="code-navigation-history">Code Navigation History</a></h3>
<p>To ease navigation in source files and especially between
different files, Geany lets you jump between different navigation
points. Currently, this works when using the <a class="reference" href="#go-to-tag-declaration">Go to tag declaration</a>,
<a class="reference" href="#go-to-tag-definition">Go to tag definition</a> commands and when clicking on symbol list
items.</p>
<p>When using one of these actions, Geany remembers your current position
and jumps to the new one. If you decide to go back to your previous
position in the file, just use &quot;Navigate back a location&quot;. To
get back to the new position again, just use &quot;Navigate forward a
location&quot;. This makes it easier to navigate in e.g.  foreign code
and between different files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28" id="send-text-through-definable-commands" name="send-text-through-definable-commands">Send text through definable commands</a></h3>
<p>You can define several custom commands in Geany and send the current
selection to one of these commands. The output of the command will be
used to replace the current selection. So, it is possible to use text
formatting tools with Geany in a general way. The selected text will
be sent to the standard input of the executed command, so the command
should be able to read from it and it should print all results to its
standard output which will be read by Geany. To help finding errors
in executing the command, the output of the program's standard error
will be printed on Geany's standard output.</p>
<p>To add a custom command, just go to the Set Custom Commands dialog
in the Format sub menu of the Edit and Popup menu. Then click on Add
to get a new text entry and type the command. You can also specify
some command line options. To delete a command, just clear the text
entry and press Ok. It will be deleted automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29" id="context-actions" name="context-actions">Context actions</a></h3>
<p>You can execute a specified command on the current word near the
cursor position or an available selection and this word is passed
as an argument to this command. It can be used for example to open
some API documentation in a browser window or open any other external
program. To do this, there is an menu entry in the popup menu of the
editor widget and also a keyboard shortcut(see the section called
<a class="reference" href="#keybindings">Keybindings</a>).</p>
<p>The command can be specified in the preferences dialog and additionally
for each filetype (see &quot;context_action_cmd&quot; in the section called
<a class="reference" href="#format">Format</a>). At executing, the filetype specific command is used if
available otherwise the command specified in the preferences dialog
is executed.</p>
<p>The passed word can be referred with the wildcard &quot;%s&quot; everywhere
in the command, before executing it will be replaced by the current
word. For example, the command to open the PHP API documentation
would be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
firefox &quot;http://www.php.net/%s&quot;
</pre>
<p>when executing the command, the %s is substituted by the word near
the cursor position or by the current selection. If the cursor is at
the word &quot;echo&quot;, a browser window will open(assumed your browser is
called firefox) and it will open the address: <a class="reference" href="http://www.php.net/echo">http://www.php.net/echo</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30" id="user-definable-snippets" name="user-definable-snippets">User-definable snippets</a></h3>
<p>Snippets are small strings or code constructs which can be replaced or
completed to a more complex string. So you can save a lot of time by
not typing often used strings and letting Geany do the work for you.
To know what to complete or replace Geany reads a configuration file
called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snippets.conf</span></tt> at startup.</p>
<p>The system-wide configuration file can be found in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix</span></tt> is the path where Geany is
installed (commonly <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt>). It is not recommended to edit the
system-wide file, because it will be overridden when Geany is updated.</p>
<p>To change the settings, copy the file from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt>
in your configuration directory (usually <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/</span></tt>).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% cp /usr/local/share/geany/snippets.conf /home/username/.geany/
</pre>
<p>Then you can edit the file and the changes are also available
after an update of Geany because the file resides in your
configuration directory. Alternatively, you can create a file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/snippets.conf</span></tt> and add only these settings you want
to change. All missing settings will be read from the global snippets
file in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snippets.conf</span></tt> may contain several sections for each
filetype. It also contains two additional sections &quot;Default&quot; and
&quot;Special&quot;. Default contains all snippets which are available
for every filetype. You may define another section for a certain
filetype(e.g. C++) containing the same snippets. Then when using
such a snippet in a C++ file the snippet defined in the C++ section will
be used. In any other file the snippet defined in the Default section will
be used unless a section for the current filetype exists and the used
snippet is defined in this section. The section &quot;Special&quot; contains special
snippets which can only be used in other snippets. So you can define often
used parts of snippets and just use the special snippet as a placeholder
(see the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snippets.conf</span></tt> for details).</p>
<p>To define snippets you can use several special characters which
will be replaced when using the snippet:</p>
<p><strong>Wildcards for snippets</strong></p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="22%" />
<col width="78%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>\n or %newline%</td>
<td>Insert a new line (it will be replaced by the used EOL
char(s): LF, CR/LF, or CR).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>\t or %ws%</td>
<td>Insert an indentation step, if using only spaces for
indentation only spaces will be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>\s</td>
<td>\s to force whitespace at beginning or end of a value
('key= value' won't work, use 'key=\svalue')</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>%cursor%</td>
<td>Place the cursor at this position after completion has
been done.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>%...%</td>
<td>&quot;...&quot; means the name of a key in the &quot;Special&quot; section.
If you have defined a key &quot;brace_open&quot; in the &quot;Special&quot;
section you can use %brace_open&quot; in any other snippet.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Defined snippets must not contain spaces otherwise they won't
work correctly. But beside that you can define almost everything
string as a snippet and use it later in Geany. It is not limited
to existing contructs of certain programming languages(like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">switch</span></tt>). Define whatever you need.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to often type your name, so define a snippet like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[Default]
myname=Enrico Tröger
</pre>
<p>Everytime you write <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myname</span></tt> &lt;TAB&gt; in Geany, it will replace &quot;myname&quot;
with &quot;Enrico Tröger&quot;. The key to start auto completion can be changed
in the preferences dialog, by default it is TAB.</p>
<p>You may change the behaviour Geany recognizes the word to complete,
i.e. where define the start and end of a word. The section &quot;Special&quot; may
contain a key &quot;wordchars&quot; which lists all characters a string may contain
to be recognized as a word for completion. Leave it commented to use
default characters or define it to add or remove characters to fit your
needs.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31" id="inserting-unicode-characters" name="inserting-unicode-characters">Inserting unicode characters</a></h3>
<p>With GTK 2.10 and above, you can hit Ctrl-Shift-u, then still holding
Ctrl-Shift, type some hex digits representing the code point for the
character you want, then let go of Ctrl-Shift and hit a key such as
the right arrow.</p>
<p>For this to work in Geany, you'll need to first unbind Ctrl-Shift-u
in the <a class="reference" href="#keybinding-tab-in-preferences-dialog">keybinding tab in preferences dialog</a>, then restart Geany.
Note that it works slightly differently from other GTK applications,
in that you'll need to continue to hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys
while typing the code point hex digits.</p>
<p>For GTK &lt; 2.10, it is also possible, but typing the first Ctrl-Shift-u
is not necessary. One problem is that you may find the alphabetic
keys conflict with other Geany keybindings.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id46" id="tags" name="tags">Tags</a></h2>
<p>Geany has built-in functionality for generating tag information (aka
&quot;workspace tags&quot;) for supported filetypes when you open a file.  You
can also have Geany automatically load external tag files (aka &quot;global
tags files&quot;) from its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/tags</span></tt> directory upon startup, or
manually using <em>File --&gt; Load Tags</em>.</p>
<p>Geany uses its own tag file format, similar to what <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctags</span></tt> uses
(but is incompatible with ctags). You use Geany to generate global
tags files, as described below.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47" id="workspace-tags" name="workspace-tags">Workspace tags</a></h3>
<p>Tags for each document are parsed whenever a file is loaded or
saved. These are shown in the Symbol list in the Sidebar. These tags
are also used for autocompletion of symbols and calltips for all documents
open in the current session that have the same filetype.</p>
<p>The <em>Go to Tag</em> commands can be used with all workspace tags. See
<a class="reference" href="#go-to-tag-definition">Go to tag definition</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id48" id="global-tags" name="global-tags">Global tags</a></h3>
<p>Global tags are used to provide autocompletion of symbols and calltips
without having to open the corresponding source files. This is intended
for library APIs, as the tags file only has to be updated when you upgrade
the library.</p>
<p>You can load a custom global tags file in two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using the <em>Load Tags</em> command in the File menu.</li>
<li>By creating a directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/tags</span></tt>, and moving or symlinking
the tags files there before starting Geany.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can either download these files or generate your own. They have
the format:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
name.lang_ext.tags
</pre>
<p><em>lang_ext</em> is one of the extensions set for the filetype associated
with the tags. See the section called <a class="reference" href="#filetype-extensions">Filetype extensions</a> for
more information.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id49" id="default-global-tags-files" name="default-global-tags-files">Default global tags files</a></h4>
<p>For some languages, a list of global tags is loaded when the
corresponding filetype is first used. Currently these are for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>C -- GTK+ and GLib</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>HTML -- &amp;symbol; completion, e.g. for ampersand, copyright, etc.</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id50" id="generating-a-global-tags-file" name="generating-a-global-tags-file">Generating a global tags file</a></h4>
<p><em>Filetypes support:</em></p>
<p>Currently this is not yet supported for Pascal, PHP and LaTeX
filetypes.</p>
<p>You can generate your own global tags files by parsing a list of
source files. The command is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
geany -g [-P] &lt;Tag File&gt; &lt;File list&gt;
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tag File should be in the format described earlier -- see the
section called <a class="reference" href="#global-tags">Global tags</a>.</li>
<li>File list is a list of filenames, each with a full path (unless
you are generating C/C++ tags and have set the CFLAGS environment
variable appropriately).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-P</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--no-preprocessing</span></tt> disables using the C pre-processor
to process <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#include</span></tt> directives for C/C++ source files. Use this
option if you want to specify each source file on the command-line
instead of using a 'master' header file. Also can be useful if you
don't want to specify the CFLAGS environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example for the wxD library for the D programming language:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
geany -g wxd.d.tags /home/username/wxd/wx/*.d
</pre>
<p><em>Generating C/C++ tag files:</em></p>
<p>For C/C++ tag files, gcc and grep are required, so that header files
can be preprocessed to include any other headers they depend upon.</p>
<p>For C/C++ files, the environment variable CFLAGS should be set with
appropriate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-I/path</span></tt> include paths. The following example works with
the bash shell, generating tags for the GnomeUI library:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
CFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags libgnomeui-2.0` geany -g gnomeui.c.tags \
/usr/include/libgnomeui-2.0/gnome.h
</pre>
<p>You can adapt this command to use CFLAGS and header files appropriate
for whichever libraries you want.</p>
<p><em>Replacing the default C/C++ tags file:</em></p>
<p>Geany currently uses a default global tags file global.tags for
C and C++, commonly installed in /usr/share/geany. This file can
be replaced with one containing tags parsed from a different set
of header files. When Geany is next started, your custom tags file
will be loaded instead of the default global.tags. You should keep a
copy of the generated tags file because it will get overwritten when
upgrading Geany.</p>

Additionally, there are some options to modify the printed page(s). You
can define whether to print line numbers, page numbers at the bottom of
each page and whether to print a page header on each page. This header
contains the filename of the printed document, the current page number and
the date and time of printing. By default, the file name of the document
is added with full path information to the header. If you prefer to add
only the basename of the file(without any path information) you can set it
in the preferences dialog. You can also adjust the format of the date and
time added to the page header. The available conversion specifiers are the
same as the ones which can be used with the ANSI C strftime function.
All of these settings can also be changed in the print dialog just before
actual printing is done.
On Unix-like systems the provided print dialog offers a print preview. The
preview file is opened with a PDF viewer and by default GTK uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evince</span></tt>
for print preview. If you don't have installed evince or just want to use
another PDF viewer, you can change the program to use in the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gtkrc-2.0</span></tt> (usually found in your home directory). Simply add a line
like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gtk-print-preview-command = &quot;epdfview %f&quot;
</pre>
<p>at the end of the file. Of course, you can also use xpdf, kpdf or whatever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, native GTK printing support is only available if Geany was
built against GTK 2.10 (or above) <strong>and</strong> is running with GTK 2.10 (or above).
If not, Geany provides basic printing support. This means you can print a
file by passing the filename of the current file to a command which
actually prints the file. However, the printed document contains no syntax
highlighting. You can adjust the command to which the filename is
passed in the preferences dialog. The default command is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% lpr %f
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%f</span></tt> will be substituted by the filename of the current file. Geany
will not show errors from the command itself, so you should make
sure that it works before(e.g. by trying to execute it from the
command line).</p>
<p>A nicer example, which I prefer is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% a2ps -1 --medium=A4 -o - %f | xfprint4
</pre>
<p>But this depends on a2ps and xfprint4. As a replacement for xfprint4,
gtklp or similar programs can be used.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id81" id="plugins" name="plugins">Plugins</a></h2>
<p>Plugins are loaded at startup, if the <em>Enable plugin support</em>
general preference is set. There is also a command-line option,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span></tt>, which prevents plugins being loaded. Plugins are scanned in
the following directories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/lib/geany</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix</span></tt> is usually <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr</span></tt>)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/plugins</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Most plugins add menu items to the <em>Tools</em> menu when they are loaded.</p>
<p>In future, there will be a plugin management dialog to load and unload
plugins, but for now any unwanted plugin library files can be deleted
after installation of Geany.</p>

<p>For all actions listed below you can define your own keybindings. Open
the Preferences dialog, select the desired action and click on
change. In the opening dialog you can press any key combination you
want and it will be saved when you press OK. You can define only one
key combination for one action.</p>
<p>Some of the default key combinations cannot be changed, e.g. menu_new
or menu_open. These are set by GTK and should be kept, but you can
still add other key combinations for these actions. For example to
execute menu_open by default <em>Ctrl-O</em> is set, but you can also define
<em>Alt-O</em>, so that the file open dialog is shown by pressing either
<em>Ctrl-O</em> or <em>Alt-O</em>.</p>

<p>The global configuration file is read from

<p>All colour definitions and other filetype specific settings are

for syntax highlighting, general settings like comment characters or
word delimiter characters as well as compiler and linker settings.</p>
<p>The system-wide configuration files can be found in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt> and are called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filetypes.$ext</span></tt>,
where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix</span></tt> is the path where Geany is installed (commonly
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt>) and $ext is the name of the filetype. For every
filetype there is a corresponding definition file. There is one
exception: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filetypes.common</span></tt> -- this file is for general settings,
which are not specific to a certain filetype. It is not recommended
to edit the system-wide files, because they will be overridden when
Geany is updated.</p>
<p>To change the settings, copy a file from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt> to
the subdirectory filedefs in your configuration directory (usually

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% cp /usr/local/share/geany/filetypes.c /home/username/.geany/filedefs/

<p>Then you can edit the file and the changes are also
available after an update of Geany because they reside in your
configuration directory. Alternatively, you can create a file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/filedefs/filetypes.X</span></tt> and add only these settings you want
to change. All missing settings will be read from the corresponding

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id94" id="filetype-extensions" name="filetype-extensions">Filetype extensions</a></h2>
<p>To change the default filetype extension used when saving a new file,
see <a class="reference" href="#filetype-definition-files">Filetype definition files</a>.</p>
<p>You can override the list of file extensions that Geany uses for each
filetype using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filetype_extensions.conf</span></tt> file.</p>
<p>To override the system-wide configuration file, copy it from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix/share/geany</span></tt> to your configuration directory, usually
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/</span></tt>. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$prefix</span></tt> is the path where Geany is installed
(commonly <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt>).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% cp /usr/local/share/geany/filetype_extensions.conf /home/username/.geany/
</pre>
<p>Then edit it and remove all the lines for filetype extensions that
you do not want to override. The remaining lines can be edited after
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt> sign, using a semi-colon separated list of patterns which
should be matched for that filetype.</p>
<p>For example, to set the filetype extensions for Make, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/username/.geany/filetype_extensions.conf</span></tt> file should
look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[Extensions]
Make=Makefile*;*.mk;Buildfile;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id95" id="templates" name="templates">Templates</a></h2>
<p>Geany supports the following templates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ChangeLog entry</li>
<li>File header</li>
<li>Function description</li>
<li>Short GPL notice</li>
<li>Short BSD notice</li>
<li>Filetype template</li>
</ul>
<p>To use these templates, just open the Edit menu or open the popup menu
by right-clicking in the editor widget, and choose &quot;Insert Comments&quot;
and insert templates as you want.</p>
<p>Some templates (like File header or ChangeLog entry) will always be
inserted at the top of the file.</p>
<p>To insert a function description, the cursor must be inside
of the function, so that the function name can be determined
automatically. The description will be positioned correctly one line
above the function, just check it out. If the cursor is not inside
of a function or the function name cannot be determined, you cannot
insert a function description.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id96" id="template-metadata" name="template-metadata">Template metadata</a></h3>
<p>Metadata can be used with all templates, but by default user set
metadata is only used for the ChangeLog and File header templates.</p>
<p>In the configuration dialog you can find a tab &quot;Templates&quot; (see
<a class="reference" href="#template-tab-in-preferences-dialog">Template tab in preferences dialog</a>). You can define the
default values which will be inserted in the templates. You should
restart Geany after making changes, because they are only read
at startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id97" id="filetype-templates" name="filetype-templates">Filetype templates</a></h3>
<p>Filetype templates are templates used as the basis of a new file. To
use them, choose the <em>New (with Template)</em> menu item from the <em>File</em>
menu.</p>
<p>By default, templates are created for some filetypes. Other filetype
templates can be added by creating the appropriate template file and
restarting Geany. You can also edit the default filetype templates.</p>
<p>Filetype template files are read from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/templates</span></tt>
directory, and are named &quot;filetype.&quot; followed by the filetype
name, e.g. &quot;filetype.python&quot;, &quot;filetype.sh&quot;, etc. If you are
unsure about the filetype name extensions, they are the same as
the filetype configuration file extensions, commonly installed in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/share/geany</span></tt>, with the prefix &quot;filetypes.&quot;.</p>
<p>The file's contents are just the text to place in the document,
except for the optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{fileheader}</span></tt> template wildcard. This can
be placed anywhere, but is usually on the first line of the file,
followed by a blank line.</p>
<p>There is also a template file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">template.none</span></tt> which is used when
the New command is used without a filetype. This is empty by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id98" id="customizing-templates" name="customizing-templates">Customizing templates</a></h3>
<p>Each template can be customized to your needs. The templates are
stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.geany/templates/</span></tt> directory (see the section called
<a class="reference" href="#command-line-options">Command line options</a> for further information about the configuration
directory). Just open the desired template with an editor (ideally,
Geany ;-) ) and edit the template to your needs. There are some
wildcards which will be automatically replaced by Geany at startup.</p>

            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
               Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
