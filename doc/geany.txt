Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1. About

   Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development
   environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE,
   which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another
   goal was to be as independent as possible from a special
   Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it is using only the
   GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime
   libraries to run Geany.

   The basic features of Geany are:

     * syntax highlighting
     * code completion
     * auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and
       while
     * auto completion of XML and HTML tags
     * call tips
     * many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python,
       Perl, Pascal
     * symbol lists
     _________________________________________________________

1.2. Where to get

   You can obtain Geany from http://geany.uvena.de or perhabs
   from your distributor.
     _________________________________________________________

1.3. License

   Geany is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public license
   as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
   of the License, or (at your option) later version. A copy of
   this license can be found in the file COPYING included with
   the source code of this program and in the appendix of this
   document.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Installation

2.1. Requirements

   For compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0)
   libraries and header files. You will also need the Pango, Glib
   and ATK libraries and header files. All these files are
   available at http://www.gtk.org.

   Further more you need, of course, a C compiler, for the
   included Scintilla library a C++ compiler and the make tool.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. Source Compilation

   Compiling Geany is quite easy. The following should do it:
                                        % ./configure
                                        % make
                                        % make install

   The configure script supports several common options, for a
   detailed list, type
                                        % ./configure --help

   In the case, that your system lacks dynamic linking loader
   support, you probably want to pass the option --disable-vte to
   the configure script. This prevents compiling Geany with
   dynamic linking loader support to automatically load
   libvte.so.4 if available.

   Geany has been successfully compiled and tested under Debian
   3.1 Sarge, Debian 3.2 Etch, Fedora Core 4, LinuxFromScratch
   and FreeBSD 6.0. It also compiles under Mircosoft Windows(TM),
   but there are lots of changes to the makefiles necessary.

   If there are any errors during compilation, check your build
   environment and try to find the error, otherwise contact the
   author at <enrico.troeger@uvena.de>.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3. Binary Packages

2.3.1. Fedora

   You can find packages for Fedora Core 4 on
   http://geany.uvena.de/ in the download section.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.2. Debian

   Binary packages for Debian are available at
   http://debian.uvena.de/. You can add one of the following
   lines(depending on your system) to your apt sources.list to
   get automatically get the latest version of Geany:

   deb http://debian.uvena.de/ ./stable/

   deb http://debian.uvena.de/ ./testing/
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.3. SuSE

   There are not yet packages for SuSE available.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Usage

3.1. Getting Started

   You can start Geany in the following ways:

     * From the Desktop Environment menu
       Choose in your application menu of your used Desktop
       Environment: Development->Geany.
     * From the command line
       To start Geany from a command line, type the following and
       press Return:
                                                                % geany
     _________________________________________________________

3.2. Commandline options

   Table 3-1. Commandline Options
   Short option Long option Function
   -n --no-ctags Do not load auto completion and call tip data.
   Use this option, if you do not want to use them. For more
   information see Section 3.3.2.
   -t --no-terminal Do not load terminal support. Use this
   option, if you do not want to load the virtual terminal
   emulator widget at startup. If you do not have libvte.so.4
   installed, then terminal-support is automatically disabled.
   -c directory_name --config=directory_name Use an alternate
   configuration directory. Default configuration directory is
   ~/.geany/ and there resides geany.conf and some template
   files.
   -d --debug Runs Geany in debug mode, which means being verbose
   and printing lots of information.
   -? --help Show help information and exit.
   -v --version Show version information and exit.
     [files ...] Opens all given files at startup. This option
   causes Geany to ignore loading stored files from the last
   session (if enabled).
   Geany supports all generic GTK options, a list is available on
   the help screen.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3. General

3.3.1. Startup

   At startup, Geany loads the 15 first files from the last time,
   Geany was launched. You can disable this feature in the
   preferences dialog(see Figure 3-2). If you specify some files
   on the commandline, only these files will be opened. But you
   can find the files from the last session in the file menu.
   There is an item "Recent files". It contains the last 15
   recently opened files. It may be that Geany not exactly loads
   15 files, this depends on the compile time option
   GEANY_SESSION_FILES, the default is 15. For details see
   Section 3.5.1.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3.2. Global C tags

   If a C file(with extension is c, cpp, h, etc.) is opened, a
   global tags file is loaded once, which contains many function
   declarations from the glibc and some other libraries, like X,
   Bonobo, Gnome, GTK, Glib and so on. These declarations are
   used for call tips and auto completion. These tags are only
   useful if you are writing C or C++ source code. So if you
   know, that you do not need these things, you can skip loading
   this tag file. To do so, start Geany with the argument "-n" or
   "--no-ctags", for more information see Section 3.2.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3.3. Virtual terminal emulator widget (VTE)

   If you have installed libvte.so in your system, it is loaded
   automatically by Geany. Then you have a terminal widget in the
   notebook at the bottom.

   If Geany cannot find libvte.so at startup, the terminal widget
   will not be loaded. So there is no need to install the package
   containing this file in order to run Geany. Additionally, you
   can disable the use of the terminal widget by commandline
   option, for more information see Section 3.2.

   You can use this terminal (from now on called VTE) nearly as
   an usual terminal program like xterm. There is a basic
   clipboard support. You can paste the content of the clipboard
   by pressing the middle mouse button in the VTE (on 2-button
   mice, the middle button can often be simulated by pressing
   both mouse buttons together) or by pressing the right mouse
   button to open the popup menu and choose Paste. To copy text
   from the VTE, just select the desired text and then press the
   right mouse button and choose Copy from the popup menu.

   Note

   Geany tries to load libvte.so. If this fails, it tries to load
   libvte.so.4. If this fails too, you should check whether you
   installed libvte correctly. Again, Geany runs also without
   this library. But it could be, that the library is called
   something else than libvte.so.4 (e.g. on FreeBSD 6.0 it is
   called libvte.so.8). So please set a link to the correct file
   (as root).
# ln -s /usr/lib/libvte.so.X /usr/lib/libvte.so.4

   Obviously, you have to adjust the paths and set X to the
   number of your libvte.so.
     _________________________________________________________

3.4. Search and Replace

   You can use regular expressions in the search dialog, just by
   activating the check box(see the image below). Detailed
   information about special characters can be found in the Table
   3-2.

   Figure 3-1. Search dialog

   [find_dialog.jpg]

   Table 3-2. Regular expressions
   In a regular expression, the following characters are
   interpreted:
   . Matches any character.
   \( This marks the start of a region for tagging a match.
   \) This marks the end of a tagged region.
   \n Where n is 1 through 9 refers to the first through ninth
   tagged region when replacing. For example, if the search
   string was Fred\([1-9]\)XXX and the replace string was
   Sam\1YYY, when applied to Fred2XXX this would generate
   Sam2YYY.
   \< This matches the start of a word.
   \> This matches the end of a word.
   \x This allows you to use a character x that would otherwise
   have a special meaning. For example, \[ would be interpreted
   as [ and not as the start of a character set.
   [...] This indicates a set of characters, for example, [abc]
   means any of the characters a, b or c. You can also use
   ranges, for example [a-z] for any lower case character.
   [^...] The complement of the characters in the set. For
   example, [^A-Za-z] means any character except an alphabetic
   character.
   $ This matches the end of a line.
   * This matches 0 or more times. For example, Sa*m matches Sm,
   Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.
   + This matches 1 or more times. For example, Sa+m matches Sam,
   Saam, Saaam and so on.

     _________________________________________________________

3.5.1. Compile time options

   There are some options which can only changed at compile time.
   To change these options, look into src/geany.h to change these
   settings. To find it, look for a block of lines starting with
   "#define GEANY_*".

   Table 3-3. Compile time options
   Option Description Default
   GEANY_MAX_OPEN_FILES The limit how many files can be open at
   the same time. 25
   GEANY_SESSION_FILES How many files should be reopened from the
   last run. Obviously, the value should be smaller than
   GEANY_MAX_OPEN_FILES. 15
   GEANY_WORDCHARS These characters define the word boundaries.
   (look at sourcecode)
   GEANY_MAX_AUTOCOMPLETE_WORDS How many auto complete
   suggestions should Geany provide. 30
   GEANY_STRING_UNTITLED A string used as name for new files. Be
   aware that the string can be translated, so change it only if
   you know what you are doing. untitled
     _________________________________________________________

3.6. File types

   should be written
     _________________________________________________________

3.7. Templates

   Geany supports several templates for file headers, multiline
   comments(frame comments), function descriptions, a typical
   ChangeLog entry and a short GPL notice. To use this templates,
   just open the edit menu or open the popup menu by
   right-clicking in the editor widget, and choose "Insert
   Comments" and insert templates as you want.

   Some templates like file header or ChangeLog entry, will
   always be inserted at the top of the file.

   To insert a function description, the cursor must be inside of
   the function, so that the function name can be determined
   automatically. The description will be positioned correctly
   one line above the function, just check it out. If the cursor
   is not inside of a function or the function name cannot be
   determined, you cannot insert a function description.

   Each template can be customized to your needs. The templates
   are in the configuration directory, which is in ~/.geany/ (see
   Section 3.2 for further information about configuration
   directory). Just open the desired template with an editor
   (ideally Geany ;-) ) and edit the template as your needs.
   There are some wildcards which will be automatically replaced
   by Geany at startup.

   All wildcards must be enclosed by "{" and "}", e.g. {date}.

   In the configuration dialog you can find a tab "Templates"(see
   Figure 3-5). You can define the default values which will be
   inserted in the templates. You should restart Geany after made
   changes, because they are only read at startup.

   Since Geany 0.3 there are also templates for creating new
   files. They can be found in ~/.geany/, too. All template files
   for creating new files begin with template.filetype. followed
   by the filetype. At creating a new file with a filetype
   template, the template for the fileheader is automatically
   prepended. Please note, that the complete behaviour is still
   under development and will probably be changed in one of the
   next releases. Sorry.


   Table 3-4. Template wildcards
   Wildcard Description Available in following templates
   developer The name of the developer. filetypes, file header,
   function description, ChangeLog entry

Appendix B. GNU General Public License

B.1. Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
   Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
   and change free software - to make sure the software is free
   for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
   of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
   program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
   Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
   General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
   programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
   not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
   sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
   software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
   receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
   change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
   forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
   surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
   responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
   software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
   whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
   the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
   receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
   these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps:

    1. copyright the software, and
    2. offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
       copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
   certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty
   for this free software. If the software is modified by someone
   else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
   they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
   by others will not reflect on the original authors'
   reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
   patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
   free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
   effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we
   have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
   everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

B.2.1. Section 0

   This License applies to any program or other work which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
   The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
   a "work based on the Program " means either the Program or any
   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification ".) Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
   are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
   The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
   output from the Program is covered only if its contents
   constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
   been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
   depends on what the Program does.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.2. Section 1

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
   intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
   Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
   copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
   exchange for a fee.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.3. Section 2

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
   portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
   copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
   of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
   conditions:

    1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
       notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
       any change.
    2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
       that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
       Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
       no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
       License.
    3. If the modified program normally reads commands
       interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
       running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
       to print or display an announcement including an
       appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
       warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
       that users may redistribute the program under these
       conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
       this License.

       Note Exception:


   If the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
   print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
   not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
   Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
   separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
   terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
   as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
   License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
   who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
   contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
   the intent is to exercise the right to control the
   distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
   Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
   Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
   on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   the other work under the scope of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.4. Section 3

   You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
   it, under Section 2 in object code or executable form under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
   one of the following:

    1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
       customarily used for software interchange; or,
    2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
       than your cost of physically performing source
       distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
       corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
       terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
       used for software interchange; or,
    3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
       offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
       alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
       and only if you received the program in object code or
       executable form with such an offer, in accord with
       Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
   work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
   complete source code means all the source code for all modules
   it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
   plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
   of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally
   distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
   system on which the executable runs, unless that component
   itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by
   offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
   counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
   parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.5. Section 4

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
   Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
   the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
   their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
   full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.6. Section 5

   You are not required to accept this License, since you have
   not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
   modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
   These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
   License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
   (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
   acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
   or works based on it.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.7. Section 6

   Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
   the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
   from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
   Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
   impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
   the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
   enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.8. Section 7

   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
   patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
   patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
   court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
   conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
   conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
   any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
   Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
   through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
   this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
   the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or
   unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance
   of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole
   is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
   infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
   contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
   purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
   distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
   wide range of software distributed through that system in
   reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
   the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
   distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
   believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.9. Section 8

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
   interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
   Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.10. Section 9

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Program specifies a version number of this License which
   applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that version or
   of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
   of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.11. Section 10

   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
   free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which
   is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
   Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
   this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
   software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
   generally.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.12. Section 11 NO WARRANTY

   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
   COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
   IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.13. Section 12

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
   MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
   LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
   SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
   TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
   OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     _________________________________________________________

B.3. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
   greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
   this is to make it free software which everyone can
   redistribute and change under these terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
   safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
   effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
   should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
   where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what
   it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
   useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
   warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
   License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
   MA 02111-1307 USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
   paper mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
   like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
   type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
   redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
   details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
   the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of
   course, the commands you use may be called something other
   than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
   menu items--whatever suits your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a
   programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
   disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;
   alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers)
   written by James Hacker.

   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of
   Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
   program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
   subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
   linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
   what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
   License instead of this License.
