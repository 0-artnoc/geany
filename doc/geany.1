.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
geany is a mini C editor using GTK2 with many features of an integrated development environment. Some of its 
features are: syntax highlighting, code completion, many filetypes, symbol lists and many more 
 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.IP "\fB-n\fP           \fB\-\-no-ctags\fP         " 10 
Don't load auto completion and call tip data. Use this option, if you don't want to use them. 
For more information see documentation. 
.IP "\fB-t\fP           \fB\-\-no-terminal\fP         " 10 
Don't load terminal support. Use this option, if you don't want to load the virtual terminal 
emulator widget at startup. If you don't have libvte.so.4 installed, then terminal-support is 
automatically disabled. 
.IP "\fB-l\fP           \fB\-\-vte-lib\fP         " 10 
Specify explicitly the path including filename or only the filename to the VTE library, e.g. 
/usr/lib/libvte.so or libvte.so. This option is only needed, when the autodetection does not 
work. 
.IP "\fB-c\fP           \fB\-\-config\fP         " 10 
Use an alternate configuration directory. Default configuration directory is 
~/.geany/ and there resides geany.conf and some template files. 
.IP "\fB-d\fP           \fB\-\-debug\fP         " 10 
Runs geany in debug mode, which means being verbose and printing lots of information. 
.IP "\fB-?\fP           \fB\-\-help\fP         " 10 
Show help information and exit. 
.IP "\fB-v\fP           \fB\-\-version\fP         " 10 
Show version information and exit.
