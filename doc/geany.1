geany is a mini C editor using GTK2 with many features of an integrated development environment. Some of its 
features are: syntax highlighting, code completion, many filetypes, symbol lists and many more

.IP "\fB-n\fP           \fB\-\-no-ctags\fP         " 10 
Don't load auto completion and call tip data at startup. Use this option, if you want geany to use 
as an simple editor without code completion or to speed up program execution.

Use an alternate configuration directory. Default configuration directory is 
~/.geany/ and there resides geany.conf and some template files. 
.IP "\fB-d\fP           \fB\-\-debug\fP         " 10
