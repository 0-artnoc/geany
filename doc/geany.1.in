.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-n\fP           \fB\-\-no-ctags\fP         " 10
Don't load auto completion and call tip data. Use this option, if you don't want to use them.
For more information see documentation.
.IP "\fB-m\fP           \fB\-\-no-msgwin\fP         " 10
Do not show the message window. Use this option if you do not need compiler messages
or VTE support.
.IP "\fB-t\fP           \fB\-\-no-terminal\fP         " 10
Don't load terminal support. Use this option, if you don't want to load the virtual terminal
emulator widget at startup. If you don't have libvte.so.4 installed, then terminal-support is
automatically disabled.
.IP "\fB-l\fP           \fB\-\-vte-lib\fP         " 10
Specify explicitly the path including filename or only the filename to the VTE library, e.g.
/usr/lib/libvte.so or libvte.so. This option is only needed, when the autodetection does not
work.
.IP "\fB-c\fP           \fB\-\-config\fP         " 10
Use an alternate configuration directory. Default configuration directory is
~/.geany/ and there resides geany.conf and some template files.
.IP "\fB-d\fP           \fB\-\-debug\fP         " 10
Runs geany in debug mode, which means being verbose and printing lots of information.
.IP "\fB-?\fP           \fB\-\-help\fP         " 10
Show help information and exit.
.IP "\fB-v\fP           \fB\-\-version\fP         " 10
Show version information and exit.
