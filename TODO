TODO List:
----------
Note: features included in brackets have lower priority.

	Fix bugs:
	o tagmanager fails on UTF-16/32


	Next version or later:
	o documentation: list and explain filetype modes
	o common default highlighting styles configurable for all
	  programming languages
	o configurable filetype and project make commands (e.g. using
	  bud for D)
	o recent projects menu
	o MRU documents switching
	o (support for adding plugin filetypes - SCI_LOADLEXERLIBRARY?)
	o (selectable menu of arguments to use for Make, from Make Custom)
	o (DBUS)
	o (indent wrapped lines  - Scintilla issue)
	o (folder tree in the sidebar)
	o (macro support)
	o (better search & replace regex support - use
	   SCI_GETCHARACTERPOINTER and GNU regex?)
	o (parsing tags from a memory buffer instead of a file on disk)
	o (calltip support for non-C-like languages that use
	   function_name(arguments) syntax)
	o (custom pipe-separated tags files support)
	o (better tags support for popular languages? - this is a moving
	   target...)
	o (tango-like icons for the symbol list)
	o (show autocompletion symbol icons - see SCI_REGISTERIMAGE)
	o (GFileMonitor support, if/when GIO gets merged with GLib)


	1.0:
	o generating tags for latex/pascal/php
	o stable plugin ABI for the 1.0 series? (Split up geany_data, prefs,
	  GeanyKeyCommand enum into groups)
	o review documentation
	o review any hidden prefs/compile time constants that could be in the
	  Prefs dialog, e.g. invert_all syntax highlighting pref


Wishlist
--------
Note: these items might not get worked on.

	o Some kind of support for CTags tags files
	o Scope resolution for object members
	o Python plugin interface (different concept from Lua scripting).
