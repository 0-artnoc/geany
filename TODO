--------
Note: These items might not get worked on.

	o Some kind of support for ctags files.
	o Scope resolution for object members.
	o Multiline regex support (requires work on Scintilla)
	o Python scripting plugin? (not as efficient as Lua, but perhaps
	  more widely known)
	o Split window editing.
