TODO List:
----------
Note: features included in brackets have lower priority.

	Fix bugs:
	o tagmanager fails on UTF-16/32


	Next version or later:
	o better file template {filename} wildcard replacement +{BASENAME}
	o print text size/zoom option
	o documentation: list and explain filetype modes
	o common default highlighting styles configurable for all
	  programming languages (done for C-like filetypes using
	  filetypes.common named styles)
	o update included regex library (and other CTags improvements)
	o (better custom filetype support)
	o (custom template insertion - so user can add licenses, etc)
	o (selectable menu of arguments to use for Make, from Make Custom)
	o (DBUS)
	o (sci macro support - as a plugin?)
	o (parsing tags from a memory buffer instead of a file on disk)
	o (tango-like icons for the symbol list)
	o (per-workspace instances with socket support?)


	1.0:
	o stable plugin ABI for the 1.0 series? (Split up geany_data, prefs,
	  GeanyKeyCommand enum into groups)
	o review documentation


Wishlist
--------
Note: these items might not get worked on.

	o (calltip support for non-C-like languages that use
	   function_name(arguments) syntax - see python.c:parseArglist())
	o (better tags support for popular languages? - this is a moving
	   target...)
	o (support for adding plugin filetypes - SCI_LOADLEXERLIBRARY?)
	o Some kind of support for CTags tags files
	o Python plugin interface (different concept from Lua scripting)
