TODO List:
----------
Note: features included in brackets have lower priority.

	Fix bugs:
	o tagmanager fails on UTF-16/32


	Next version or later:
	o documentation: list and explain filetype modes
	o common default highlighting styles configurable for all
	  programming languages (done for C-like filetypes using
	  filetypes.common named styles)
	o configurable filetype and project make commands (e.g. using
	  bud for D) - see the build-system SVN branch
	o (support for adding plugin filetypes - SCI_LOADLEXERLIBRARY?)
	o (selectable menu of arguments to use for Make, from Make Custom)
	o (DBUS)
	o (sci macro support)
	o (better search & replace regex support e.g. multiline - use
	   SCI_GETCHARACTERPOINTER and GNU regex?)
	o (parsing tags from a memory buffer instead of a file on disk)
	o (tango-like icons for the symbol list)
	o (show autocompletion symbol icons - see SCI_REGISTERIMAGE)


	1.0:
	o stable plugin ABI for the 1.0 series? (Split up geany_data, prefs,
	  GeanyKeyCommand enum into groups)
	o review documentation
	o review any hidden prefs/compile time constants that could be in the
	  Prefs dialog, e.g. invert_all syntax highlighting pref


Wishlist
--------
Note: these items might not get worked on.

	o (calltip support for non-C-like languages that use
	   function_name(arguments) syntax - see python.c:parseArglist())
	o (better tags support for popular languages? - this is a moving
	   target...)
	o Some kind of support for CTags tags files
	o Python plugin interface (different concept from Lua scripting)
