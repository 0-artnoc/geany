TODO List:
----------
(features included in brackets have lower priority)

	Fix bugs:
	o fix bug that prevents UTF-16, UTF-32 files from being loaded.
	o tagmanager fails on UTF-16/32


	Next version or later:
	o documentation: list and explain filetype modes
	o documentation: preferences
	o common default highlighting styles configurable for all
	  programming languages
	o basic support for adding custom filetypes?
	o configurable filetype and project make commands (e.g. using
	  bud for D)
	o recent projects menu
	o project indentation settings support
	o plugin keybindings
	o (line breaking mode to limit words on a line for e.g. XML content)
	o (DBUS)
	o (indent wrapped lines  - Scintilla issue)
	o (folder tree in the sidebar)
	o (macro support)
	o (better regex support)
	o (parsing tags from a memory buffer instead of a file on disk)
	o (calltip support for non-C-like languages that use
	  function_name(arguments) syntax)
	o (better tags support for popular languages? - this is a moving
	  target...)
	o (tango-like icons for the symbol list)
	o (show autocompletion symbol icons - see SCI_REGISTERIMAGE)
	o (custom template file support)


	1.0:
	o generating tags for latex/pascal/php
	o include standard library tags only for C global.tags (offer
	  separate GTK tags file for download)
	o stable plugin ABI for the 1.0 series? (Split up geany_data, prefs,
	  GeanyKeyCommand enum into groups)
	o review documentation


Wishlist
--------
Note: These items might not get worked on.

	o Some kind of support for ctags files.
	o Scope resolution for object members.
	o Multiline regex support (requires work on Scintilla)
	o Split window editing.
	o Python scripting plugin? (not as efficient as Lua, but perhaps
	  more widely known)
