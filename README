Geany - A fast and lightweight IDE
----------------------------------


About
-----
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent
as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it
is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the
GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.


Features
--------
The basic features of Geany are:
- syntax highlighting
- code completion
- auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while
- auto completion of XML and HTML tags
- call tips
- folding
- many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
- symbol lists
- embedded terminal emulation


Requirements
------------
For compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need the Pango, Glib and ATK libraries and
header files. All these files are available at http://www.gtk.org.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; a C++ compiler
is also required for the included Scintilla library. The GNU versions of these
tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Installing Geany is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment and
try to find the error, otherwise contact the author at <enrico.troeger@uvena.de>.


Usage
-----
To run Geany just type
$ geany
on a console or use the applications menu from your desktop environment.
There a few command line options. See the manual page of Geany or run
$ geany --help
for details. Or look into the documention in the doc/ directory.
The most important option probably is -c or --config, wherewith you can specify an alternate
configuration directory.


Windows
-------
Geany runs also under Windows. To download the binary with all necessary files,
visit Geany's homepage. But you should know, that the Windows version is not yet
well tested and there are some features missing:
- build support (perhaps will be added later, Run command is working)
- embedded terminal emulation (VTE)
